# literally-just-a-website - WIP
Literally Just a Website is a website with a collection of simple web projects designed to demonstrate basic web development skills.

# Overview
This website features a collection of interactive web pages, each one being a seperate basic project.<br><br>
The website will be focused on the frontend, meaning the goal is to create a smooth and engaging user experience where they can find simple projects and informations about the creator of the website.<br><br>
The backend won't be the priority, meaning the website will have fewer backend functionalities.<br> 
Also, great to know this git repo only contains the frontend. Backend repo [here](https://github.com/dlmpires/literally-just-a-website-backend) <br><br>
This project is being built with seperate repositories, one for the frontend (this repo), and one with the backend. The project is structured in this way to promote better organization and modularity. 

# Technologies
Frontend: React(Next.js), SASS, JavaScript - Built in next.js<br>
Backend: Express.js
